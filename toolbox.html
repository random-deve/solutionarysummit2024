     <h1>The Sustainability Compass</h1>
    <p>
      The compass is a tool developed for sustainability and systems thinking.
      It emphasizes interdependency and interdependence. We use this tool to
      understand how different topics and workshops can relate to these four
      different compass points and it gives us an idea of how the workshops
      fits into the grander scheme of the conference and changemakers in general.
      In addition, it is a common framework used and provides a shared language
      and terminology when discussing local and global issues, and more.

    Before digging into the issues that we care about, we must first
    build care and strength for our own self.

  <h1>MISO Method</h1>
  <p>To easily investigate other perspectives in K-12 and in higher education,
    we can use a service learning research tool: MISO.
    Originator Cathryn Berger Kaye and her collaborators Shei Ascencio
    and LeeAnne Lavender of CBK Associates, they created the MISO method of research.

  <h1>MO-GO Questionnaire <br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-size: 25px;">(Designed by the Institute for Humane Education)</span></h1>
  <p id="left-text">Most questions are divided into three parts: <br> <br>
    <span style="line-height: 30px;">
      a. What you currently do (so that you can identify the ways you're already living your values); <br>
      b. What you want to learn/do (so that you can set goals for living a more MOGO life);<br>
      c. What steps will you take (so that you are making specific, actionable plans for living with deeper integrity).

    <h1>The Root Cause Analysis Tree</h1>
    <p>
      This model is developed to help us understand the actual issue that is being addressed and it provides a very nice jumping board when working with problem-solving and finding solutions. <br>
      First, address what the central problem is which is how you define the general issue, and you then work to analyze the symptoms of the issue which also includes its impact, etc. You then lastly identify what is actually causing the issue and this is also where you can develop a solution to the issue.
